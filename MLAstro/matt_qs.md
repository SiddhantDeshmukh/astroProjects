# Questions for Matt

- How do you get spectra? Best sources?
  - ESO for raw spectra! Either Gaia ESO (Giraffe, HARPS, UVES)
  - Matt only uses a few stars, I could just mine some stuff via a query?
  - Gemini 1 has GIRAFFE spectra resolution 20,000 ~100,000 spectra (already labelled)
  - Some wavelength ranges are very small! How can I ensure that the alg
    sees enough blended lines?
- Practices governing fake data? Either fully making fake spectra or adding
  fake blends
  - Ask Jeff for Turbospectrum single-line mode.
- Line lists?
  - Probably not available
- Does SAPP learn "on-the-job"?
  - no
- What's the best way to gather a large amount of training data?
  - Matt just manually does it, probably set up a querying script
- What are interesting things to look at in the Gaia DR?
  - maybe exoplanets?
