Place: Online

Start of thesis: 15 August 2019

Tentative title: _Non-equilibrium processes in cool stellar atmospheres_

During the third TAC meeting, two aspects were discussed:

1. Defence Requirements
2. Publications

## Concerning Defence Requirements

Teaching and lecture requirements have been fulfilled. The astronomy lab course
is the final requirement that will be clarified soon. The prerequisite
requirements have been met according to the thesis committee, but confirmation
from the HGSFP is required.

## Concerning Publications

While no papers have been accepted thus far, a paper concerning the solar
silicon abundance has been submitted and resubmitted, and will be
resubmmited for a second time in the coming few weeks. A paper regarding
chemical disequilibrium processes in carbon enhanced metal-poor dwarf stars
is estimated to be submitted mid-June. A third paper concerning a similar
analysis in red giant stars is expected to be submitted shortly afterwards,
but the recommendation from the committee was to focus on the former two papers
due to the time constraints.
