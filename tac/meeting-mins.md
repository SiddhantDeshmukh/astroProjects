# TAC Meeting Minutes

Participants:

- Siddhant Deshmukh (PhD student)
- Prof. Dr. Norbert Christlieb (supervisor)
- Apl. Prof. Dr. Stefan Jordan (advisor)
- Dr. Hans-G. Ludwig (advisor)

Date/time: 17 February 2021, 15:00-16:00

Place: Online

Start of thesis: 15 August 2019

Tentative title: _Non-equilibrium processes in cool stellar atmospheres_

During the second TAC meeting, two aspects were discussed:

1. Thesis work
2. Teaching and course obligations

## Concerning Thesis Work

As discussed in the previous TAC meeting (23 August 2019), start-up work
was to take over a project investigating the solar silicon abundance with
a publication within the year. Due to complications in the work, the
project is still ongoing and submission is expected mid-April 2021. As this
project is not directly related to the primary objective of the thesis
(concerning chemical evolution and equilibrium in stellar atmospheres),
focus has shifted towards the thesis in recent months. Preliminary models
investigating chemical evolution in a solar and metal-poor atmosphere have
been computed, and the scope for publication should be made clear mid-April
2021 as well. Immediate goals are to compare a full chemical evolution to
a ``post-processing'' evolution (where the chemistry is evolved from
pre-computed model snapshots), implement the chemical evolution code KROME
into CO$^5$BOLD, and investigate the CH evolution in metal-poor
atmospheres.

## Concerning Teaching and Course Obligations

The teaching obligations will be fulfilled by 12 March 2021. The courses
are _Physik A_, _Fundamentals of Simulation Methods_ and
_Python: programming for scientists_.

The course on _Galaxies_ will be followed in the coming winter term.
