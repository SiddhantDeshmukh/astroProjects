# Asteroseismology - what makes stars tick

Speaker: Saskia Hekker

Use oscillations intrinsic to the star to probe stellar interiors.

## Modes

Generally, deeper modal lines have less oscillations, e.g. radial only
has one that goes through the star, dipole has more causing "loop" modes
around the star, etc.
Radial - cross through the star, causing its radius to change (pulsations)

Many regions on the H-R diagram have stars that oscillate, but not all. E.g.
even the Sun oscillates (helioseismology). Saskia works on solar-like 
oscillations, so oscillations that are similar to those in our Sun.
All stars with a convective outer region (> 5-6000 K) can have these,
i.e. solar-type stars, subgiants and giants.

Method: take a light curve, FT it and look at frequencies.
Typical frequency nuMax gives a measure of the radius of the star (0th mode).
Sun: 3000 microHertz frequency, period of ~ 5 minutes. Typically we see
0th, 1st and 2nd mode, sometimes 3rd, but often not higher.

Large frequency separation scales with mean density of star and it is the
separation between the different 0th modes. Since the nuMax gives a measure
of the radius, from this we can get a very accurate measurement of the mass!
Small frequency separation is the difference between the 1st modes, and is an
integral over the sound speed in the star. From this, we can get the He mass
fraction, as H-burning changes the sound speed.

Sometimes we may see to 1st modes (dipoles) next to each other, whereas
normally we would see "0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, ...". Reason: We have some
resonance! See "Brunt-Vaisala frequency, buoyancy (inner) cavity",
"Lamb frequency, acoustic (outer) cavity".
These are called "mixed modes". Trade off between gravity modes and
pressure modes?
Outer cavity: pressure-dominated.

Red clump: Stars went through Helium flash
Other giants: Stars do core He burning
RGB: Hydrogen shell burning

With convection, gravity modes cannot oscillate.

## Rotation and inclination

If frequency goes with rotation, everything gets blueshifted and vice versa.
Pole-on: We only see radial mode. Equatorial: We see radial and dipolar+
modes. Mixed modes are split with rotation (rotational splitting) in the
power spectrum. From this, we can compare models of solid-body to
core-rotation to figure out how the core rotates wrt the envelope.

## Attributes

In general (and except for the "bump" in the evolution!), stars have a
"mirror", so shells move inwards at one point and are countered by shells
moving outwards at another.

Stationary point: location below which shells move inwards and above which
shells move outwards (or vice versa):
$\partial{r} / \partial{t} = 0$

Pivot: location where gravothermal energy generation rate changes sign -
location where shells transition from compressing to expanding

epsilonG = 0 === -T $\partial{s} / \partial{T}$

During the bump, there is no mirror!
