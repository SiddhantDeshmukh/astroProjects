# (EXCALIBUR pipeline), 22/11/21

## Summary (Mark Swain)

- Provide best estimate of science params "like Google Earth" instead of like
  old space missions. i.e. we want some sort of live retrieval, not a long
  process to then analyse later.
- Bayesian formalism, sampler-based posterior estimation.
- 4 papers published this year.
- Has been validated and adopted/suggested for a few missions

## Exoplanet atmosphere characterisation from transit spectra (Gael Roudier)

- stellar light curve and instrumental effects introduce systematic errors,
  need to do heavy post-processing of data, depends on instrument and pipeline
